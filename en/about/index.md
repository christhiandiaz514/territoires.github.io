Territoires creates digital tools that contribute to the social and cultural development of territories.

Our cooperative focuses on developing a family of web platforms that empower organisations, citizens and communities to visualize and broadcast  information that reflects the vitality of territories, in a structured and open way.

Territoires is a multi-stakeholder cooperative founded in Montr√©al in the fall of 2013.
