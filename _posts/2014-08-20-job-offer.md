Territoires is looking for a human being to oversee the development of Caligram, a service that will equip organizations and communities from around the world with excellent event calendars. It will be built as open source software and aim to contribute to the commmon good through the free flow of event-related information.

The main technological decisions surrounding Caligram, such as the choice of a programming language, have yet to be made. We want to involve in this process an experienced developer who will head the development effort as a working member of the cooperative.

Our offices are in the Mile End, in a bright space shared with around 20&nbsp;friendly people as well as a dog and a rabbit.

+ Part-time or full-time, depending on availability;
+ Flexible schedule;
+ A wonderful working space with a breathtaking view on Montr√©al.

Interested? Please contact us by August 29<sup>th</sup>, 2014.
